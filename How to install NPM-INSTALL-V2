Final notes & troubleshooting tips

Privileged container required — this script sets CT_TYPE="1" to ensure Docker can run inside the LXC. If you change to unprivileged, Docker in LXC will fail unless you perform complex workarounds (and grant many capabilities).

Network — ensure the container has network access (DNS, gateway). The script already checks connectivity during creation, but if your environment is restricted, fix container network first.

Check progress — if the pct exec post-install fails:

Enter container: pct enter <CTID>

View /root/npm-install-inside.sh and /opt/npm/docker-compose.yml

Run journalctl -u docker -b inside container to see Docker service errors

Run docker ps to inspect containers and docker logs <container> for details

Credentials & persistence

DB credentials are set to npm:npm (change in /opt/npm/docker-compose.yml if you prefer stronger creds)

Data persists at /opt/npm/data and MariaDB at /opt/npm/data/mysql

Access — once complete open http://<container-ip>:81. Default login (first time) is admin@example.com / changeme.

Key Fixes:

✅ Script asks for LXC root password before creating container

✅ Script asks for MariaDB root password

✅ Supports Debian 12 or Ubuntu 24.04

✅ Uses Docker Compose with MariaDB persistence

✅ Works on Proxmox 4.1 → 8.x

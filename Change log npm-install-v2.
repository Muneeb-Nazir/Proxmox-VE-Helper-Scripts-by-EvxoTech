below is a fully cleaned, self-contained Proxmox LXC creation + Dockerized Nginx Proxy Manager (with MariaDB) script that:

Keeps the UI & helper functions from the original build.func but overrides the version check to accept Proxmox >= 4.1 (so it supports 4.1 and newer) by doing a numeric check rather than brittle regex.

Overrides the build path so it only creates the LXC and does not run the old OpenResty/pnpm flow.

After LXC creation it runs a self-contained post-install inside the container that:

Updates the OS,

Installs Docker CE + compose plugin,

Deploys jc21/mariadb-aria + jc21/nginx-proxy-manager using Docker Compose,

Persists data under /opt/npm

Enables Docker to start on boot.

Uses a privileged container by default (recommended for running Docker reliably in an LXC).

Leaves var_os / var_version (so you can still choose Debian/Ubuntu and versions via the script UI).

Prints final container IP and access URL at the end.

Save this file on your Proxmox host (for example /root/npm-proxmox-docker.sh), make it executable (chmod +x npm-proxmox-docker.sh), then run it as root: ./npm-proxmox-docker.sh.
